# runa-interview-test

- to run this properties is necessary to create a local file named: "cypress.env.json" with this pattern ("inside the quotes, insert the desired naming"):
I choose to use this as in some contexts we have sensitve data, o valid credentials, 

{
    "first_name": "",
    "last_name": " ",
    "user_name": " ",
    "passwd": " ",
    "confirmPasswd": " ",
    "phone_number": " "

},

- after cloning the project, run the command npm install and after, "npx cypress open" at the terminal
- some best cypress best pratices were used such as base-url, app actions and commands
